Geography: estimate areas) Use the GPS locations for Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; and
Charlotte, North Carolina in the figure in Section 4.1 to compute the estimated area enclosed by these four cities.
(Hint: use the formula in programming exercise 4.2 to compute the distance between two cities. Divide the polygon into
two triangles and use the formula  in Programming Exercise 2.19 to compute the area of a triangle.)
